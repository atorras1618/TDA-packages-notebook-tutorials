    "# Ripser C++ code Notebook Tutorial\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is a survey tutorial for the C++ Ripser code module by Ulrich Bauer. This tutorial is a work in progress created by Alvaro Torras Casas, Cardiff University, 2022 for didactic and educational purposes. This is aimed at non-`C++` experts and non-TDA experts. If you are an expert, you might find this boring.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we consider the source code from the famous C++ Ripser module which computes persistent homology. The original code can be found on this repository: \n",
    "\n",
    "[1] Ulrich Bauer, https://github.com/Ripser/ripser, 2015–2021 \n",
    "\n",
    "Also, the ideas of this code are very well explained at the following article:\n",
    "\n",
    "[2] Bauer, U. Ripser: efficient computation of Vietoris–Rips persistence barcodes. J Appl. and Comput. Topology 5, 391–423 (2021). https://doi.org/10.1007/s41468-021-00071-5\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial has no claims of originality, rather than for didactic and educational purposes. \n",
    "It is rather a notebook to go through some of the parts of the original code, breaking down it into small-easy-to-understand pieces. We also put some references to [1] and [2] along this text.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Notebook setup:\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that for running this notebook you need to have a `c++` kernel installed in jupyterlab. This can be done thanks to `xeus-cling` (https://github.com/jupyter-xeus/xeus-cling) for which you will probably need to install before `miniconda`. Notice that even though `xeus-cling` maintainers say that they do not support packages for the Windows platform, you can still get around this problem by using Windows Subsystem for Linux. To know whether you have successfully installed the `c++` kernel, type:\n",
    "\n",
    "`jupyter kernelspec list`\n",
    "\n",
    "If `xcpp11`, `xcpp14` and `xcpp17` do not appear on the list, you might have to got to the folders where the `xeus-cling` kernels where installed and run\n",
    "\n",
    "`jupyter kernelspec install xcpp11 xcpp14 xcpp17`\n",
    "\n",
    "It took me a while to get this working though. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Ripser Tutorial:\n",
    "\n",
    "First of all, to avoid any licence problems, we copy the associated licence below. Also, we omit some parts of the original code and might have modified it at some places. Also, the order in which we present the code here does not necessarily need to follow the original. However, the idea is that once one understands this tutorial, it should be easy to read the original code from [2]."
